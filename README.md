About Me:
I am an aspiring Python developer with a growing foundation in software fundamentals. My work focuses on developing small, well-structured projects that strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts such as functions, data structures, loops, and file handling. I use Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and learning, and PyCharm for building more organized, scalable projects.

Projects and Experience:

Dungeon Game Project: Developed a text-based adventure game using Python, featuring structured game logic, modular functions, and JSON-based map data.
Notebook Exercises: Completed a series of hands-on mini-projects covering Python basics, formatted output, data manipulation, error handling, and command-line interactions.
Project Structure & Documentation: Experienced in organizing projects with virtual environments, maintaining clear folder structures, and writing clean, understandable Markdown documentation.

Interests:

Analyzing and debugging code to understand and resolve issues
Building small programs that turn ideas into functional solutions
Documenting processes and refining workflows
Continuously expanding my knowledge toward more advanced Python development



I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT-5.1) to support me for everything

Purpose of AI use:
- Assisting in debugging by explaining error messages and suggesting fixes.
- Providing general guidance on Python concepts when needed.
- Brainstorming and generating initial ideas for the software design.

All code was reviewed, tested, and adapted by me.  
ChatGPT did not write the full project; I maintained full control over the final implementation.

Tool used:
